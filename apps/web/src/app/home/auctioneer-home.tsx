/**
 * THE AUCTIONEER'S HOME — and before RN-1 there was no such surface at all.
 *
 * `roles.conducts` has always been an ARRAY. The shell took `[0]` and /home
 * showed one banner, so somebody appointed to run four nights across three
 * clubs could see exactly one of them and had no record of the rest. There was
 * nowhere in the product that answered "what am I running, and what have I
 * run" — which is the whole of this person's relationship with the platform.
 *
 * Its one job (RN-1 §0): run tonight. So the page is Tonight, then the queue,
 * then the record — urgency, then commitment, then history.
 *
 * Deliberately no figures beyond status. A conductor holds `auction.conduct`
 * and nothing else: not registrations, not money, not the club's books. A
 * "total spend" column here would be the roster-and-money leak all over again,
 * arriving through the back door of a résumé.
